# Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is
# rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
#
# [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
# [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
# Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]
# 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
#
# Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
